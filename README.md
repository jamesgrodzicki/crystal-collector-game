# crystal-collector-game

This game is about collecting values from crystals and ending up at randomly chosen number.

## Getting Started

Each gem is assigned a random value from 2 through 12 at the start of every game. There is a score that you want to match every game as well. Your personal score gets added to everytime you click on a crystal and eventually you want your score to match the target score. Then the game will reset and a notification that you won will pop up (or lost in case your score went over the target).

Thank you jquery for being beasts and making my code life easier. Also same to bootstrap I guess. Although mostly to Jquery :P
